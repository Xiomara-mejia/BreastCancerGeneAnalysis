# Breast Cancer Gene Expression Analysis

This project explores gene expression profiles to identify patterns in breast cancer samples using R and Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools Used
- R
- Jupyter Notebook
- ggplot2
- dplyr

## Goals
- Visualize gene expression differences
- Identify significant genes
- Support potential biomarkers research

## Results
Below are some key findings from the gene expression analysis:

Differential Expression: Several genes showed significantly different expression between breast cancer subtypes.
Top Genes Identified:
BRCA1 and TP53 were among the most upregulated genes.
GATA3 and FOXA1 showed subtype-specific patterns.
Clustering Patterns:
Hierarchical clustering and PCA revealed distinct groupings based on gene expression profiles.
Visualizations:
Volcano plots highlighted significant genes.
Heatmaps illustrated expression trends across samples.
For detailed visual output, see the notebook in this repository.
